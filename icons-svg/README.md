Run `npm run dev` to view the page on `http://localhost:5173/`. The instruction is ultimately unnecessary, you can very well test the page opening `index.html` yourself, but you might enjoy hot reloading.

`icons.svg` houses the code for 6 icons positioned side by side.

With an `img` element:

- refer to `icons.svg` to include every icon

- refer to `icons.svg#view-id` to include one of the icons highlighted through the `<view>` element:

  - `#bar-chart`

  - `#line-chart`

  - `#candlestick-chart`

  - `#table-chart`

  - `#pie-chart`

  - `#tree-diagram`
